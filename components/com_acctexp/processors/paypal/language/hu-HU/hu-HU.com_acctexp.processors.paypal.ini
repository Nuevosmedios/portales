To work around this, you can for example create a new subdomain on this server and disable the loadbalancing for this. Putting this address in here (In the form >>http://subdomain.domain.com<< - no trailing slash and whatever you want for subdomain and domain) will make sure that Paypal sends only the IPN back to this Address. <strong>If you are not sure what this means, leave it completely blank!</strong>"
