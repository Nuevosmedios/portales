Integration of Patch definition 1.0.5 that correct a bug in the configuration wrapper.
Due to an error in the configuration file name, a syntax error can appear due to an attempt

This error only appear with extension that use the configuration directly
and when it is called from a slave site.

Also change the 'jos_' error level into notice level.
Update the comment to explain in which condition 'jos_' table prefix is allowed.
'jos_' table prefix can only be used when this is the only website that is stored in the database.
(Case of as many databases than there are websites).

that could be disabled or have insuffisent privilege.

-------------------- 1.0.4 Stable Release [10-August-2008] ---------------------
Bug Fix:
Correct the path displayed when a slave site created. This is the path where the slave site must be mapped.
The path was wrong for all platform except WINDOWS.

Enhancement:

  When not created, this is a symtom that JMS has not enought permission.
- Add some file permission checking to inform the user he has not enough rights to apply the patches.

-------------------- 1.0.3 Stable Release [04-August-2008] ---------------------
Enhancement:
- Add a check if the master table prefix is jos_
  If yes, report an ERROR to the user.
  Keep jos_ as table prefix will result in deletion of all the users and therefore result in the impossibility
  to login into the master website.

-------------------- 1.0.2 Stable Release [02-August-2008] ---------------------
Bug Fix:
In the version 1.0.0, the 'configuration.php' file in the master directory was not touched.
Some extension perform a direct access to this 'configuration.php' file that will result
in a wrong database connection and database table prefix.
To solve this problem, this version add awrapper to the Master 'configuration.php' file
in aim to root it to the appropriate slave site. This means also that a patch is delivered
to allow saving the configuration with this wrapper.


Enhancement:
Add JMS2WinFactory and Jms2WinModel to allow connection to the Master database.
This new feature open the door to single User Authentication, Single content management and other
